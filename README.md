# OTML Practical 2: Model Fitting and Error Measurement

## 1. Aim

The aim of this practical is to understand how a machine learning model is fitted on training data and how its performance is measured using error or accuracy-based evaluation.

In this practical, students use a simple Music Genre Recommendation System to train a supervised learning model and evaluate how well the model predicts the correct music genre based on user information such as age and gender.

## 2. Course and Module Mapping

**Course:** A8751 – Optimization Techniques in Machine Learning  
**Module:** Module 1 – Model Fitting and Error Measurement  
**Practical Topic:** Model Fitting and Error Measurement using a Music Genre Recommendation System

This practical is mapped with Module 1 of OTML, where students learn the basic idea of model fitting, prediction, error measurement, and evaluation of machine learning models.

## 3. Theory Background

In machine learning, **model fitting** means training a model using available data so that it can learn the relationship between input features and output labels.

A dataset usually contains:

- **Input features:** Variables used by the model for prediction.
- **Output label:** The target value or class to be predicted.
- **Training data:** Data used to teach the model.
- **Testing data:** Data used to evaluate the trained model.

In this practical, the input features are:

age, gender
